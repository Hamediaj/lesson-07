Academy Archery Project

Below are the following features I added to this Archery project (index, about and services page):

1. The first feature I added is the ability to skip the navigation menu. I added this so that when users are using a screen recorder they have the option to skip the navigation menu.
2. The second feature I added is a better description of the alt tag for images. This is because the descriptions I originally used weren't really describing what the image is.
3. The third feature I added is a meaningful link. I made sure that each webpage title is short but descriptive so that the user's know what page they need/want to access.
4. For the video included I made sure to have different formats included and a tag to include browser non-compatibility.
